Thanks for your interest in contributing to emacs-anywhere! I try to get pull requests checked in quickly, but many stall out before getting merged for one of the reasons below.

When submitting a pull request to emacs-anywhere, keep the following in mind...

1. Every feature in emacs-anywhere should be cross platform (OSX & Ubuntu at least). I usually won't merge changes unless they're cross platform.
2. Everything should work out of the box by running the install script.
3. Any new functionality added should be documented in the README first. When proposing new features, consider making the documentation changes first as a proposal and sending me a pull request.

If you have any questions or suggestions, feel free to get in touch!
